<h1>FAQ</h1>

<details open>
    <summary>What does this site do?</summary>
    <p>
        This is a semantic search engine built on RePEc data. It helps you find related academic
        work by comparing text embeddings. It works best if you paste the abstract of your paper
        or an abstract from your literature. The engine returns the closest matches found in the
        RePEc archive.
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What kind of text should I paste?</summary>
    <p>
        You do not need a full abstract. Any paragraph with clear ideas works. Examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Research questions</li>
        <li>Paper introductions</li>
        <li>Blog or research note intros</li>
        <li>News-style leads summarising a topic</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The model works on meaning rather than exact keywords. Complete sentences provide the best results.
    </p>
    <p>
        More context improves accuracy. For example:
        <br />
        Instead of: “climate Germany”
        Try: “What was the impact of climate policies in Germany in the 2000s”
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Does the tool work in multiple languages?</summary>
    <p>
        Yes. The model handles English, German and several other languages. Search quality is stable across
        languages, but language choice may imply a country or topic indirectly.
        For example, a German input may retrieve German studies even without an explicit mention of Germany.
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>How often is the database updated?</summary>
    <p>
        The internal database is updated once per month. The main site shows the date of the last update.
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Which journals and series are included?</summary>
    <p>
        The search engine does not index the full RePEc archive. It currently covers a curated
        subset of roughly 250 major journals and working paper series. These were chosen based on
        academic relevance, data quality and availability of abstracts suitable for embedding.
    </p>
    <p>
        The list is not fixed. Additional journals or series can be added when users point out
        gaps or when high quality metadata becomes available. If something important is missing,
        feel free to write to
        <a href="mailto:eduard.bruell@zew.de">eduard.bruell@zew.de</a>.
    </p>
</details>


<details>
    <summary>Does the site store anything when I search?</summary>
    <p>
        Saved searches are stored so you can revisit them.
        For maintenance and performance monitoring the backend keeps lightweight statistical logs:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>A hash of the query text (not the text itself)</li>
        <li>Number of results returned</li>
        <li>Top three RePEc handles</li>
        <li>Filter flags used</li>
        <li>Response time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These entries support debugging and quality improvements. They are not shared with third parties.
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Who can I contact if something looks wrong?</summary>
    <p>
        Please send corrections, feedback or unexpected match examples to
        <a href="mailto:eduard.bruell@zew.de">eduard.bruell@zew.de</a>.
