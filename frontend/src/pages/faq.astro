    <summary>What does this site do?</summary>
    <p>
        This is a semantic search engine built on RePEc data. It helps you find related academic
        work by comparing text embeddings. It works best if you paste the abstract of your paper
        or an abstract from your literature. The engine returns the closest matches found in the
        RePEc archive.
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What kind of text should I paste?</summary>
    <p>
        You do not need a full abstract. Any paragraph with clear ideas works. Examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Research questions</li>
        <li>Paper introductions</li>
        <li>Blog or research note intros</li>
        <li>News-style leads summarising a topic</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The model works on meaning rather than exact keywords. Complete sentences provide the best results.
    </p>
    <p>
        More context improves accuracy. For example:
        <br />
        Instead of: “climate Germany”
        Try: “What was the impact of climate policies in Germany in the 2000s”
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Does the tool work in multiple languages?</summary>
    <p>
        Yes. The model handles English, German and several other languages. Search quality is stable across
        languages, but language choice may imply a country or topic indirectly.
        For example, a German input may retrieve German studies even without an explicit mention of Germany.
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>How often is the database updated?</summary>
    <p>
        The internal database is updated once per month. The main site shows the date of the last update.
    </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Which journals and series are included?</summary>
    <p>
        The search engine does not index the full RePEc archive. It currently covers a curated
        subset of roughly 250 major journals and working paper series. These were chosen based on
        academic relevance, data quality and availability of abstracts suitable for embedding.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can view the full list of indexed journals and working paper series here:
        <a href="/journals">Journal Coverage</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The list is not fixed. Additional journals or series can be added when users point out
        gaps or when high quality metadata becomes available. If something important is missing,
        feel free to write to
        <a href="mailto:eduard.bruell@zew.de">eduard.bruell@zew.de</a>.
    </p>

    <summary>How should I read the citation badges?</summary>
    <p>
        Each result card shows a few small badges that summarise how influential a paper is
        within the RePEc dataset. These statistics are based only on the subset of journals
        and working paper series included in this search engine.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Citations</strong>: Total number of papers in the full RePEc citation graph that cite this paper.</li>

        <li><strong>Citations (in DB)</strong>: How many of those citing papers are part of the curated database used by the search engine.</li>

        <li><strong>References</strong>: Number of papers that this paper cites (within the curated dataset).</li>

        <li><strong>Top Percentile</strong>: A percentile rank showing how this paper compares to all other papers in the database by citation count.
            Higher values mean the paper is more cited. For example, “96 Top Percentile” means it is among the most cited four percent of papers in the dataset.
        </li>

        <li><strong>Med. Cited-by Percentile</strong>: A percentile rank for the papers that cite this one.
            It captures the typical influence level of the citing papers. A higher number means that this paper is cited by more influential papers on average.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These indicators are meant to provide a quick sense of a paper’s visibility and the influence of the papers that cite it.
        They should not be interpreted as full citation metrics for the entire RePEc corpus as citation data here is unfortunetaly incomplete.
    </p>
</details>


<details>
    <summary>Does the site store anything when I search?</summary>
    <p>
        Saved searches are stored so you can revisit them.
        For maintenance and performance monitoring the backend keeps lightweight statistical logs:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>A hash of the query text (not the text itself)</li>
        <li>Number of results returned</li>
        <li>Top three RePEc handles</li>
        <li>Filter flags used</li>
        <li>Response time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These entries support debugging and quality improvements. They are not shared with third parties.
    </p>
